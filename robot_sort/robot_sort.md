 bubble up + down
        swap_item
        while light is on?
        right
        compare 
            lower
            keep on
                function that moves right if it can
                or else it turns the light off
            higher 
                swap then right
        I found this out later but 
        I turn the light on immediatley and turn it off
        after every swap. 
        if the light stays on for an entire loop that means
        the list is sorted.


insertion sort (Started with this but didn't work)
        take first item
        move right
        compare 
            if larger
             move right
            if smaller
             swap
             move right

        grab first item
        move right 
            while moving right compare
            if value is greater:
            swap
            if value is smaller
            keep moving right
        when you get to the end
        compare and swap if needed

        move left
            while moving left compare
            if value is smaller
            swap and keep moving left
            else
            keep moving left
